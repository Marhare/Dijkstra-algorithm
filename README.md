# Dijkstra Pathfinding Implementation

This project is a visual implementation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, a fundamental graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

## Project Goal
The objective was to practice programming logic and data structures by visualizing how the algorithm explores a grid/graph and determines the optimal path based on edge weights.

## Visual Output
Below is a screenshot of the algorithm in action, showing the explored nodes and the final calculated shortest path:


## Technical Details
- **Language:** Python.
- **Logic:** Implemented using a priority queue (or the logic you used).
- **Visualization:** [Menciona aquí si usaste Pygame, Matplotlib o solo texto].
